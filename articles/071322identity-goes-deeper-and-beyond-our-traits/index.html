      <h3>Essay Prompt: You discovered you are good (or bad) at something but you weren‚Äôt supposed to be because of your sex:  you are a man but you sure can knit a mean sweater, decorate a living room, write poetry and make jewelry.  You are a woman but you sure are good at deep sea fishing, boxing, physics, working on your boyfriend‚Äôs car and you can design a building in a single bound.  How did this construct your identity as a woman or a man?</h3><br>
      <p>
        The
      early 2000s, cassettes on the floor, CDs in the car, and really big
      computer monitors and Televisions. I was four years old and just
      discovering the world and its idiosyncrasies. Young, curious, and in
      the midst of exploration to what the world has to offer. I would
      consider my family very much traditional ‚Äî we have a father to
      provide a ‚Äúpillar‚Äù for provision, discipline, and familial
      work-ethic. We grew up with a wonderful mother fitting the typical
      clich√© of ‚ÄúLight of the Home‚Äù, a pillar of our emotional
      quotient, nurturing, and affection. The father was taking care of the
      more ‚Äútough‚Äù and ‚Äúlogical‚Äù skills to be thought to us as
      children. Maybe how to handle a wrench, change a spare tire, and fix
      some basic plumbing. While the mother, takes care of the more
      ‚Äúemotional‚Äù, ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù, and mental wisdom that is needed in
      this world. May it be how to deal with heartbreak, how to handle
      grief, and how it‚Äôs always okay to validate your own emotions. 
      Growing up, I was very close with my mother. As much as, I was raised
      to be ‚Äútraditionally masculine‚Äù wherein toughness and grit has
      always been glorified, my mother has always been there to balance out
      the need for the ‚Äúsofter‚Äù and more ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù side of one‚Äôs
      self. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As
      I have grown and explored the world in the years to come, I was very
      much ‚Äúa boy‚Äù. I would play with Hot Wheels, Pro-Wrestling Action
      Figures, and I even had a favorite "sandok" üáµüá≠ growing up that I would
      take with me to bed and let it ‚Äúsleep‚Äù beside me. I was into
      sports, I loved watching basketball and when I finally grew over
      5‚Äô11‚Äù I became (albeit a little bit undersized) a varsity
      basketball player. I would get rowdy, get into fights, and do a lot
      of stupid decisions. As the saying goes, ‚Äúboys would be boys‚Äù and
      I was very much a part of that group targeted by the clich√©. My
      assumption to the causation of my adolescent ‚Äútraditionally
      masculine‚Äù personality is that I was in an environment wherein my
      upbringing was very much traditional and old-school, hence, I became
      more of the prototypical male growing up. Especially as I have spent
      more time learning skills and attributes from my father during my
      developmental years.</p>
      <p>
        I
      have never really questioned my gender identity nor my sexual
      orientation; however, even in my ‚Äútraditionally masculine‚Äù
      personality, I was never really afraid to do or express anything that
      would be labeled as ‚Äútraditionally feminine‚Äù either. Again,
      growing up close to a mother with a very high emotional quotient, I
      was never afraid to cry and express vulnerability. The saying of ‚Äúyou
      <u>_________</u>
      like a girl‚Äù just never made sense, as my mother was a strong role
      model for me in-terms of emotional intelligence.  Which is why I
      became fully open to the fact that I also love to appreciate more
      classically feminine endeavors like musical theatre, softer romantic
      films, expressions of emotions like poetry and monologues. Even having a decent level of knowledge when it came to 
      women‚Äôs fashion and make-up, despite being, a ‚Äútraditionally
      masculine‚Äù straight male. I love understanding emotions, deep
      conversations, vulnerabilities, and many other psychological
      interests. Now as the essay prompt centers on ‚ÄúHow did this
      construct affect your identity as a woman or a man?‚Äù, I say it
      impacted me very little. I never really perceived that as a male with
      some feminine interests should make me rethink my construct as a
      person. I was simply a male who was able to get in-touch with his
      grittier and more rugged masculine side and his more feminine and
      emotionally strong side. The causation of which, can be appointed to
      my traditional upbringing wherein I can find security in both sides
      of my humanity, without having to waiver in my security and identity
      as a person. Men can have feminine traits too, and women can have
      masculine traits as well. 	</p>
      <p>
        Identity
      goes deeper and beyond than just our traits.
