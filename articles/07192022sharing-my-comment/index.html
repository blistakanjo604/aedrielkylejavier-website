      <p>I recommend that you watch both of their videos so you could see
        where I was coming from. </p>

      <p>Here was my comment on TRG's below:</p>

      <h1>"""""""</h1>


      <p>Ironically, there's a lot of "missing the point" fallacies at play, in a
        conversation about something being pointless ðŸ˜‚ I think Chris was really
        talking about the DESKTOP EXPERIENCE of the distro, which I can kind of attest
        to. I install Ubuntu on all of my family's PCs and I recently updated their
        laptops. They complained that Firefox (now a snap, in 22.04) launched much
        slower than before. They're definitely not tech savvy at all and I just
        installed Ubuntu on their systems for performance since they're on slightly
        older hardware (I also prefer troubleshooting on Linux, than Windows ofc ðŸ˜‰).
        So for them to notice a rather bad user experience, kind of goes to show that
        the desktop experience may not as great as it used to be. Rarely heard
        complaints from them when it comes to running Linux, in fact, it was mostly
        praises. I can still see the value of snap packages, it's was a great idea
        theoretically even on the server side of things. However, for it to be a little
        bit "half-baked" and be pushed on for default applications on Ubuntu DESKTOP,
        was not their best idea."</p>


      <p>Now when it comes to server and the huge impact of Ubuntu to the
        rest of the Linux community: being the preferred server distribution
        (myself included), its many important corporate partnerships, the great
        contributions to GNOME development, and the 65+ derivatives from itâ€¦ I
        definitely 100% agree with you, it's great! and it's an important part
        of our Linux sphere, all the points that you just listed out for Ubuntu
        COLLECTIVELY are absolutely true and correct â€” and in some ways they're
        indisputable.</p>


      <p>Chris talked about the Ubuntu Desktop experience "declining", which could be a cause of concernâ€¦ I'm pretty
        sure most of us started on Ubuntu because it just worked and their wasn't any glaring concerns with itâ€¦ now with
        snaps, unfortunately
        there is. Snaps are simply going to be terrible for someone who is going to try Linux for the first time on an
        older laptop with a 7200 RPM Hard Drive, and that's how people usually get started on Linux. This is very much
        similar to how
        things were in the 12.04+ days, everyone was concerned about the DESKTOP EXPERIENCE of the Unity Desktop. 12.04+
        on the server, still GREAT; Canonical during those days, made BIG STRIDES in the Linux community collectively
        (still important);
        Unity's Compiz contributions, OUTSTANDING. That still didn't change that the early days of Unity was not a good
        user experience on the desktop, not to mention the added Amazon telemetry ðŸ˜¬.</p>

      <p>You made great points about Ubuntu as a whole outside the desktop sphere, and glossed over the desktop aspect
        of it during the latter part of the video. Your main point centered on Ubuntu's importance in the "Linux
        Economy" as a whole (which
        again, it's correct and true). Chris made decent points about Ubuntu on the desktop and its worsening
        user-experience, and only briefly mentioned (if at all) its importance in other spheres of the Linux community.
        His main point centered on
        just the Ubuntu Desktop experience, where in most of his points were also true and correct. </p>

      <p>I do lean towards your perspective more. I no longer use Ubuntu, but I still find many avenues to contribute
        back to the distro because I am aware of its importance as an "OG".</p>

      <p>Two very valid main points from you and Chris. The thing is, your main points don't necessarily go directly
        against each other, nor does it really address each other.
        </p>

        <p>Hence, (unfortunately) "missing the point" ðŸ˜….</p>

      <p>Ubuntu can still be a crucial part of the Linux community (as you have said), but still have a less than
        desirable desktop experience as it transitions into snap packages (as Chris has said). There's no need to
        insinuate that the other
        person is smoking a crackpipe or dead wrong & stupid ðŸ˜‚ you two made valid and great points for two different
        things. </p>

      <h1>"""""""</h1>

      <p>I guess that speaks for itself in most cases. Have a good rest of the day
        y'all ðŸ˜…</p>
