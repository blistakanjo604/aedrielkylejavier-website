        <p>Had some time to do a redesign on my personal website, today 😌. I did my best to "decrease the clutter" and make viewer experience more "streamlined".</p>
        <p>I am a big fan of "no-bloat" webpages as I have noticed modern websites tend to use a lot unnecessary "fluff" that lead to slower page load times and increased CPU usage on the client-side, due to the use of large CSS libraries and redundant javascript execution. I am passionate about web access in third-world/developing countries (wherein bandwidth can be limited), this is why I prefer to build useful and functional — yet minimal websites.</p>
        <p>Overall footprint of the site is only at 0.96 MiB (and yes, that includes the pictures and other graphics on the page). It uses "sane" CSS written from scratch and "libré" javascript.</p>
        <p>I think the original "Web 1.0 inspired" design of the site has looked very dated (obviously) so I settled on redesigning it with the focus on modern mobile devices, while still keeping its old-school "web 1.0" simplicity when it came to how it was built. Needed improvements to navigability and viewer experience were also focused on 👍🏽.</p>
